    "My customer has a list of five home locations in Milan that are compatible with his budget. He wants to select the best place to live, according to the nearby venues. In particular, he wants to select the place that offers leisure time possibilities, such as Cinemas, theaters and restaurants and transportation services, such as Metro and Bus stations. He has a clear idea on which are his priorities and he asked me to analyze the neighborhood for each of the five home location candidates. "
